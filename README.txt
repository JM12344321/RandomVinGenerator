### RANDOM VIN GENERATOR ###

Hi! This is a small, simple tool for generating VIN numbers that aren't from the Reagan administration.
Click the buttons and have your information ready for you to paste!
I also have added a small button that adds +10 to mileage and price to avoid potential caching issues with automotive web services.

Built with:
+ .NET Core
+ C# 8.0.409
+ WPF

Make sure you're using the correct SDK!

Credits:
+ Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/doaaalsenani/usa-cers-dataset
+ ChatGPT was used for boilerplate scaffolding and code validation.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:
This tool generates synthetic VIN data derived from a public dataset.
It does not provide, reveal, or infer any real personal identifying information.
Any attempt to misuse VIN data for doxxing or identity tracing is illegal.
Use responsibly.
